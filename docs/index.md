# Welcome!

`river` is a Python library for [online machine learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning). All the tools in the library can be updated with a single observation at a time, and can therefore be used to process streaming data. This is general-purpose library, and therefore caters to different machine learning problems, including regression, classification, and unsupervised learning. It can also be used for adhoc tasks, such as computing online metrics, as well as performing drift detection.

We recommend that new users begin with the [getting started guide](getting-started.md). Afterwards, you can check out the [user guide](user-guide/reading-data), which contains recipes and tutorials on specific topics. The [API reference](api/overview) is a catalogue of all the available modules, classes, and functions that are available. Finally, check out the [examples section](examples/batch-to-online) for comprehensive usage examples.
