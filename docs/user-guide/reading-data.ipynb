    "In `creme`, the features of a sample are stored inside a dictionary, which in Python is called a `dict` and is a native data structure. In other words, we don't use any sophisticated data structure, such as a `numpy.ndarray` or a `pandas.DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using plain `dict`s is that it removes the overhead that comes with using the aforementioned data structures. This is important in a streaming context because we want to be able to process many individual samples in rapid succession. Another advantage is that `dict`s allow us to give names to our features. Finally, `dict`s are not typed, and can therefore store heterogenous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage which we haven't mentionned is that `dict`s play nicely with Python's standard library. Indeed, Python contains many tools that allow manipulating `dict`s. For instance, the `csv.DictReader` can be used to read a CSV file and convert each row to a `dict`. In fact, the `stream.iter_csv` method from `creme` is just a wrapper on top of `csv.DictReader` that adds a few bells and whistles.\n",
